  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires laravel/passport ^11.3 -> satisfiable by laravel/passport[v11.3.0, 11.x-dev].
    - laravel/passport[v11.3.0, ..., 11.x-dev] require illuminate/auth ^9.0 -> found illuminate/auth[v9.0.0-beta.1, ..., 9.x-dev] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.

You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, e.g. "composer require laravel/passport:*" to figure out if any version is installable, or "composer require laravel/passport:^2.1" if you know which you need.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
